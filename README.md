# cfa_azure module
## created by Ryan Raasch (Peraton)
##

The `cfa_azure` python module is intended to ease the challenge of working with Azure via multiple Azure python modules which require the correct steps and many lines of code to execute. `cfa_azure` simplifies many repeated workflows when interacting with Azure, Blob Storage, Batch, and more. For example, creating a pool in Azure may take different credentials and several clients to complete, but with `cfa_azure`, creating a pool is reduced to a single function with only a few parameters.

# Components
The `cfa_azure` module is composed of three submodules: `batch`, `clients`, and `helpers`. The module `clients` contains what we call the AzureClient, which combines the multiple Azure Clients needed to interact with Azure and consolidates to a single client. The module `helpers` contains more fine-grained functions which are used within the `batch` and `clients` modules or independently for more control when working with Azure.


### clients
Classes:
- AzureClient: a client object used for interacting with Azure. It initializes based on a supplied configuration file and creates various Azure clients under the hood. It can be used to upload containers, upload files, run jobs, and more.
To customize the logging capabilities of cfa_azure, two environment variables can be set. These are LOG_LEVEL and LOG_OUTPUT.

LOG_LEVEL: sets the logging level. Choices are:
- debug
- info
- warning
- error

LOG_OUTPUT: sets the output of the logs. Choices are:
- file: saves log output to a file, nested within a ./logs/ folder
- stdout: saves log output to stdout
- both: saves log output to both file and stdout

Example:
```
export LOG_LEVEL="info"
export LOG_OUTPUT="stdout"
```
#### Functions
- create_pool: creates a new Azure batch pool using default autoscale mode   
  Example:
  ```
  client = AzureClient("./configuration.toml")
  client.create_pool("My Test Pool")
  ```
- update_scale_settings: modifies the scaling mode (fixed or autoscale) for an existing pool
  Example:
  ```
  # Specify new autoscale formula that will be evaluated every 30 minutes
  client.scaling = "autoscale"
  client.update_scale_settings(
      pool_name="My Test Pool",
      autoscale_formula_path="./new_autoscale_formula.txt", 
      evaluation_interval="PT30M"
  )

  # Set the pool name property to avoid sending pool_name parameter on every call to update_scale_settings
  client.pool_name = "My Test Pool"

  # Use default 15 minute evaluation interval
  client.update_scale_settings(autoscale_formula_path="./new_autoscale_formula.txt")

  # Switch to fixed scaling mode with 10 on-demand EC2 nodes and requeuing of current jobs
  client.scaling = "fixed"
  client.update_scale_settings(dedicated_nodes=10, node_deallocation_option='Requeue')

  # Switch to fixed scaling mode with 15 spot EC2 nodes and forced termination of current jobs
  client.update_scale_settings(low_priority_nodes=15, node_deallocation_option='Terminate')
  ```
- update_containers: modifies the containers mounted on an existing Azure batch pool. It essentially recreates the pool with new mounts. 
  Example:
  ```
  # First create a pool
  client = AzureClient("./configuration.toml")
  client.set_input_container("some-input-container")
  client.set_output_container("some-output-container")
  client.create_pool(pool_name="My Test pool")

  # Now change the containers mounted on this pool
  client.update_containers(
      pool_name="My Test pool",
      input_container_name="another-input-container",
      output_container_name="another-output-container",
      autoscale_formula_path="./new_autoscale_formula.txt",
      force_update=False
  )
  ```
  If all the nodes in pool were idle when update_containers() method was invoked, Azure Batch service will recreate the pool with new containers mounted to /input and /output paths respectively. However, if any nodes in pool were in Running state, then the following error shall be displayed:

  There are N compute nodes actively running tasks in pool. Please wait for jobs to complete or retry withy force_update=True.

  As the message suggests, you can either wait for existing jobs to complete in the pool and retry the update_containers() operation. Or you can changethe force_update parameter to True and re-run the update_containers() operation to immediately delete the pool and recreate it with new containers.
